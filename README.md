Developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam, utilizing various machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. The project involves implementing and comparing the accuracy of these algorithms while employing diverse data cleaning and preprocessing techniques including Porter Stemmer, Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, and WordNet Lemmatizer.



**Features:**
1. SMS Spam Detection: Efficiently identifies and filters out spam messages, ensuring users receive only relevant SMS content.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Powered by Streamlit, the web application provides an intuitive and interactive user experience.
3. Cloud Deployment: Hosted on the Streamlit platform, ensuring easy accessibility and availability for users.
